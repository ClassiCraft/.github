**ClassiCraft** is a community-driven Survival SMP with light MMO mechanics, town systems, and seasonal events.  
We focus on **player freedom, progression, and collaboration** — blending the classic Minecraft survival feel with modern community and roleplay features.

## 🌍 Server Identity

ClassiCraft is built around these core values:
- **Community-first gameplay** → Towny nations, player-run shops, and shared progression.
- **Balanced progression** → Custom economy, prestige ranks, and skill trees that add depth without creating pay-to-win barriers.
- **Optional MMO elements** → Skills, light dungeons, and events for those who want more challenge.
- **Creative world-building** → Aether-inspired floating islands, custom ores, dungeons, and seasonal events.
- **Inclusive and fun** → Pride events, community-driven content, and optional roleplay support.
